ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm **Subhrajit Choudhury**, a PhD student in Public Policy and Management at Georgia State University.

I study behavioral public management, strategic decision-making in organizations, and leadership-driven outcomes in public service systems.

Before academia, I worked as a bureaucrat in the Indian government. Iâ€™m passionate about blending research with real-world practice in the public and non-profit sectors.

ðŸ§  This website showcases my academic and professional work. Youâ€™ll find my CV, projects, writing, and more.
